dataset600 size: 231301 with a tokenizer of vocab size of 600
dataset1200 size: 237806 with a tokenizer of vocab size of 1200
dataset3000 size: 241138 with a tokenizer of vocab size of 3000

ðŸ”Ž Interpretation:

Larger vocab sizes generally result in fewer tokens per phrase (since longer or composite patterns can be tokenized as one).

Smaller vocab sizes may produce more tokens (more splits), but might offer better generalization or compression.

âœ… 2. Average Input Length (Optional Analysis)
You can calculate:

Average number of tokens per input_ids in each dataset.

Average label length (target side).
